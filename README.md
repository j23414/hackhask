# hackhask

HackHask is me hacking at haskell until it is beaten into submission and I have 
emerged victoriously, master of all I see! Mwahahaha!

Mostly, it's me reading through tutorials, implementing the code, and being 
surprised everytime something doesn't work as I'd expect.

[An awesomely named tutorial](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)

## Some basics

```
$ ghci                     #  Welcome to the world of Haskell
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> :l script         -- That's the letter L for LOAD script.hs
Prelude> :quit             -- You are leaving the world of Haskell
$ ghi script.hs            # compile haskel script
$ ./script                 # run from bash command line
```
